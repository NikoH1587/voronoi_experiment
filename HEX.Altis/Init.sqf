/// Description;
///
/// HEX is a persistent mission, where real-time battles are generated from hex&counter wargame system.
/// Playable in singleplayer or multiplayer up to 20 players.
/// Customizable factions (DLC or mod) with freedom of forces scale, ratio and composition.
///
/// Players can choose the role of Commander, Leaders or Soldiers.
/// Commander dictates strategic actions on hex board, and tactics with High Command interface.
/// Leaders put Commander's orders in action, with a squad of Soldiers in real-time combat.
///
/// Campaign is split in multiple two-part phases, with progressing time and weather:
/// Strategic phase: Turn-based manouvers of counters on strategic hex-board.
/// Tactical phase: Connected counters are played out in real-time battle.
///
/// Counters are divided in two types: Primary and Auxiliary.
/// Primary (Infantry, Motorized, Mechanized, Armored, Recon) spawn tactical groups.
/// Auxiliary (Artillery, Support, Aircraft, Helicopters, Anti-Air) spawn strategic units.
///
/// Victory over enemy counters is achieved by capture of area in tactical battle.
/// Counters captured will be initially disorginized, and ultimately destroyed.
/// Campaign victory is achieved by destroying enemy Headquarters counter.
